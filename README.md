# Explainable Predictions of COVID-19 Infection from Chest X-rays

Investigation of Explainable Predictions of COVID-19 Infection from Chest X-rays with Machine Learning

## Getting Started

## Notes on this project

The folder `covid-cxr` is originally the [COVID-CXR project](https://github.com/aildnont/covid-cxr.git).
To work with it, we cloned it (commit [`bf79a5c62bdc9b58666056e31893c02515d550c7`](https://github.com/aildnont/covid-cxr/commit/bf79a5c62bdc9b58666056e31893c02515d550c7)) and modified it so that it works with a larger dataset.

This is how we set up the folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aildnont/covid-cxr.git covid-cxr
# Remove git folder and docs
rm -rf covid-cxr/.git covid-cxr/.github covid-cxr/docs
```
